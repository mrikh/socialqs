## Setup

### If you want to have a look at the code
Clone the project or download it. Open it using Android Studio and press the 'run' button (The green play icon on the IDE). We don't recommend this since the Emulator for Android studio is pretty slow and doesn't show some UI elements like toast messages. We recommend downloading our demo apk below instead.

### Demo the application
Download the apk from the link below and install it on the connected Android Device. You may have to allow "install from unsupported sources" in the settings to make it work!
